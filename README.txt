This is a simple rebalancing mod for Assault Rifles in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, created by Roger Larkan with tools designed by DTZxPorter.

This mod is only usable on PC, and it's effects will NOT be present in co-op modes. This is a singleplayer modification only.

Damage of all assault rifles has been increased by 30%, and the spread/inaccuracy of ARs has been reduced by 30% as well.

To install this mod, download the zip file. Extract all contents to your AFOP root directory (the folder that contains AFOP.exe).

If warned that duplicate files exist, select 'Replace'. This is VERY important.

Launch the game. Once loaded into your save, the changes to AR behaviour should be visible.

If at any point you want to uninstall this mod, delete the folder named 'blue' from your AFOP root directory. Deleting the dbgcore.dll and
dbgcore_old.dll files is not required in any way. Deleting these will break your game.

You do not need to uninstall the mod before co-op. Co-op will work as normal, just the changes will not be present for the duration.
Upon returning to singleplayer mode, ARs will once again have increased damage and reduced spread.
